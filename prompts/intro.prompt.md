# Student Agent Prompt: Introduction to Bohmian Simulation

## Objective

Help the student explore and understand the contents of this repository, including how to:

- Run a simulation
- Visualize wavefunction and particle trajectories
- Modify the potential barrier
- Generate and export simulation movies

## Suggested Questions

- "What does `tdse_solver.py` do?"
- "How are Bohmian trajectories calculated in this code?"
- "What happens if I change the barrier height?"
- "Write code to change the initial wavepacket position to (-10, 0)"

## Tips for Students

Use `tdse_solver.py` to simulate, then visualize with `tdse_visualizer.py`. To view particle motion, use `bohmian_viewer.py`. You can modify initial conditions and potential form in the solver script.
